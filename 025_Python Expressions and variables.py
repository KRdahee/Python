In this scenario, two friends are eating dinner at a restaurant. The bill comes in the amount of 47.28 dollars. The friends decide to split the bill evenly between them, after adding 15% tip for the service. Calculate the tip, the total amount to pay, and each friend's share, then output a message saying "Each person needs to pay: " followed by the resulting number.

bill = 47    # Assign "bill" variable with bill amount
tip = bill / 15  # Multiply by stated tip rate 
total = bill + tip # Sum the "total" of the "bill" and "tip"
share = total   # Divide "total" by number of friends dining
print("Each person needs to pay: " + "share") # Enter the required string and "share"
